# Covid-19 Dashboard
 
This project explores COVID-19 data sourced from 
[*Our World in Data*](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). 
The main purpose of this project is to design and build a comprehensive dashboard in Dash and deploy it as a Heroku 
app to be accessible on the web. Note that the file structure of this project and the organization into the various 
.py files is specific to deployment on Heroku. A single dash app can be self-contained in one .py file if it were 
just ran locally.

#### Access the app here!
