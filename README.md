# covid19
 
This project explores COVID-19 data sourced from ourworldindata.org. The main purpose of this project is to design 
and build a comprehensive dashboard in Dash and deploy it as a Heroku app to be accessible on the web. Note that the 
file structure of this project and the organization into the various .py files is specific to deployment on Heroku. 
A single dash app can be self-contained in one .py file if it were just ran locally.
